      question: "Do I need special software to play?",
      answer:
        "Not for offline modes! You can enjoy single-player and local multiplayer without any setup. However, to own digital assets, earn tokens, and trade in the marketplace, you'll need to authenticate with Internet Identity for a seamless and secure experience.",
      category: "Getting Started",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it pay-to-win?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely not! While different characters have varying stats, skill is the primary factor in winning matches. Free characters are competitive, and the game focuses on player ability over investment. Think of premium characters as collectible skins with stat variations, not power advantages.",
      category: "Gameplay",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I earn real rewards?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Win matches to earn our native ICP tokens, which have real value and can be transferred within the Internet Computer ecosystem. You can also sell rare characters you've unlocked or purchased to other players in our marketplace.",
      category: "Economy",
    },
    {
      question: "How does matchmaking work?",
      answer:
        "Our skill-based matchmaking system pairs players of similar abilities. We track wins, losses, and performance metrics to ensure fair, competitive matches. No pay-to-win mechanics affect matchmaking rankings.",
      category: "Multiplayer",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes the system fair and transparent?",
      answer:
        "We use the Internet Computer's built-in randomness and transparency features for all game mechanics. All outcomes are verifiable on-chain, providing cryptographic proof that results are fair and cannot be manipulated.",
      category: "ICP",
    },
    {
      question: "Are smart contracts audited?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Our canisters (smart contracts) have undergone security audits and are open-source. You can verify all canister code on the Internet Computer dashboard. Transparency and security are our top priorities.",
      category: "Security",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the current development status?",
      answer:
        "We're actively developing MetaHead Arena! Core game mechanics are being built, and ICP integration is in progress. Follow our community channels for regular updates on development milestones and early access opportunities.",
      category: "Development",
    },
    {
      question: "When can I play the game?",
      answer:
        "We're targeting a beta release in Q4 2024. Early access will be available for community members who join our development journey. The full release is planned for Q1 2025 with all features complete.",
      category: "Development",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I play on mobile?",
      answer:
        "Currently, the game is optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile support is planned for a future update, but we want to perfect the core experience first.",
